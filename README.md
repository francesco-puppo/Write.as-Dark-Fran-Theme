# Write.as Dark Fran Theme

*A beautiful dark theme for your Write.as blog*

I created this theme to make sure that [my blog](https://blog.iamfran.com) was in line with the design of [my personal website](https://iamfran.com).

## Features

* Dark palette with **orange highlights**
* **CSS variables** to quickly change colors
* Customized pages for **tags archives**
* **Shadows** for every image
* Fully **responsive**
* Some **animations** to make everything look nicer

## Notes

### Images shadow

The shadow is applied to all images and doesn't play nice with PNGs.

If you want to remove it, you can edit the code under `/*** ANIMATIONS ***/`.

### Animations

After playing a bit with a few options I decided to go with something simple and not too distracting.
There are now two animations when opening a blog post: the hashtag next to the title will fade in a change from grayscale to orange, and the same will happen to the images.

If you want to remove it, you can comment or delete the code under `/*** ANIMATIONS ***/`.

## To do

* Customize all different type formats (i.e. `code`)
* ~~Add more animations (maybe)~~
